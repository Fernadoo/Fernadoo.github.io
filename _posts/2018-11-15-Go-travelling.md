Go traveling. I guess this is the topic I am gonna talk about today. Almost every day, there are materials about traveling posted on the social network, like WeChat, Twitter. Maybe there is sort of psychological impact on your social relationships. But I wanna talk about something in our inner space. From deep inside, we do need travelling.

From my perspective, go traveling means switching to another life style. Why would I say that? Actually these days I’ve been thinking about such a problem. We are now learning or researching on campus day by day. What we are struggling for is a so-called better future life, which working in your office day by day. I cannot see differences between theses two patterns, maybe it seems to be a little pessimistic, but it is indeed a problem we have to figure out, sth about the meaning of our lives.

It makes me recall my travel to Swiss. Those cute towns just scattered among the mountains. At that time I cannot help thinking, people living here must be incredibly happy due to their casual access to nature. However, Suppose at the same time, a Swiss group may just arrive in Shanghai, and be shocked by those skyscrapers and the convenience of public transportation.

You see what I mean? Traveling may be not mainly about how beautiful or how prosperous your destination is, not that much. The main point is about change. What cheers us up in fact is that we jump out of our daily pattern and start to imagine someone else’s amazing life. 

We always need some fresh air.Go travelling when life sucks!
